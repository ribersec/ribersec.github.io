I am from the Netherlands and decided to create a website about my interests in security and my learnings in some offsec certifications, as well as some other stuff.

I have been working in IT since 2005 and still enjoying it every single day, some days more than others.
Since 2017 i have been very interested in security. Later on i have taken the courses eJPT and eCPPT from eLearnSecurity.
The 14th of june this year (2020) i will start with the OSCP course from Offensive Security.
