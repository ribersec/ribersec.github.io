As first, English is not my native language so there could be some mispeelings ;-).

I am a security enthousiast and decided to create a website about my interests in security and my learnings in some offsec certifications, as well as some other stuff.

I have been working in IT since 2005, as a system/network administrator./
Since 2017 i have been working as a Security Engineer/Security Officer.

In my path to becoming an OSCP i have taken the courses eJPT and eCPPT from eLearnSecurity as a preperation./
The 14th of june this year (2020) i will start with the OSCP course from Offensive Security.

I am still learning new things every day that i want to share on this website.
Feel free to cantact me or follow me on twitter.

Cheers!
