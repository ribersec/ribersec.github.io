As first, English is not my native language so there could be some mispeelings ;-).

I am a security enthousiast and a freetime bug bounty hunter.

I have been working in IT since 2005, as a system/network administrator.  
Since 2017 i have been working as a Security Engineer/Security Officer.

Feel free to cantact me or follow me on twitter.

Cheers!
